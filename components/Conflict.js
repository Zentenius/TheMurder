            <p  className='mx-auto p-5  md:w-3/5 indent-8 text-gray-400 pb-10 md:text-2xl'>Macbeth is rife with blood, beginning with the opening combat between the Scots and the Norwegian invaders. Once Macbeth and Lady Macbeth begin their deadly trip, blood begins to signify their guilt, and they begin to believe that their crimes have soiled them in a way that cannot be wiped away. &quot;Will all the huge Neptune&apos;s ocean clean this blood from my hand?&quot; Even though his wife scolds him and claims that a little water will do the trick, Macbeth weeps after killing Duncan. Later, when she travels through the hallways of their castle at the end of the play, she learns to experience his frightened sense of being tainted. Blood represents the perpetual feeling of guilt.</p>

          Macbeth and Banquo had defeated a rebel army who had wanted to attack the King Duncan of Scotland. While they were heading back to Scotland, they came across three witches. The witches greeted Macbeth as Thane of Glamis, Thane of Cawdor and the soon to be King of Scotland. The witches told Banquo that he would never be a King but his children would be. Macbeth became focussed on becoming the King of Scotland and realised that the only thing that stood in his way was King Duncan himself. Macbeth was a good man who was kindhearted and not able to intentionally hurt anyone without being coaxed. On the other hand, his wife was cruel and ruthless and easily planned how they would kill King Duncan so they would be King and Queen of Scotland. When the king stayed with the Macbeths at Dunsinane Castle, Macbeth reluctantly and fearfully killed King Duncan and his two guards. Duncan&apos;s sons discovered his body and quickly left Scotland which made them suspects of the murder. Due to this, Macbeth was made King of Scotland.

          Macbeth continued to ensure that he would remain King by trying to destroy anything or anyone who would stand in his way. He ordered Banquo and his son Fleance to be assassinated. Fleance managed to survive but Banquo was killed. All the wrongdoings mentally tortured Macbeth and he was continuously haunted by Banquo&apos;s ghost. Macbeth decided to revisit the three witches to demand answers to find out about his future. He left reassured that Macduff would not be able to harm him as the witches told him that no one born of a woman could harm him. Macduff fled to England to form an army with English and other Scottish Lords who hated Macbeth. Macduff&apos;s castle was seized by Macbeth and his family and staff were killed. Lady Macbeth was haunted by the weight of all the murders which resulted in her sleepwalking, having nightmares and acting insane. Lady Macbeth passed away and Macbeth lost all his friends and respect of the kingdom. He no longer wanted to live and looked forward to dying where he would finally find peace of mind. The kingdom was attacked by Macduff and his army. Macbeth realised he had been tricked by the witches as Macduff told him he was ripped from his mother&apos;s womb before her time. Mackbeth fought fearlessly but was beheaded by Macduff.

          Macbeth was a man with a good heart who allowed himself to become greedy for the power of becoming the king. He had become merciless and was hated by everyone.  After his death, all peace was returned to Scotland and Malcolm became the new king.

          After defeating a rebel army, Macbeth and Banquo meet three witches who prophesize that Macbeth would become King of Scotland. They tell Banquo that he would never be a King but that his children would be. Macbeth is a man with a good heart who allow himself to become greedy for the power of becoming King of Scotland. His cruel and ruthless wife plans and coaxes Macbeth to kill King Duncan while he is staying with them at Dunsinane Castle. Macbeth becomes King of Scotland and continues to kill anyone who stands in the way of his kingship. He fears Banquo and orders that he and his son Fleance be assassinated. Fleance manages to survive but Banquo is killed. He had become merciless and was hated by everyone.  All the wrongdoings mentally torture Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Macbeth revisits the three witches to demand answers about his future. They warn him of Macduff who is a threat to him and trick him into believing that he is invincible. Macduff&apos;s castle is seized by Macbeth and his family and staff are killed. Lady Macbeth passes away and Macbeth loses all his friends and the respect of the kingdom. He no longer wants to live and looks forward to dying where he will finally find peace of mind.  Macduff and his army retaliate and attack Macbeth&apos;s kingdom. He fights fearlessly but is beheaded by Macduff. After King Macbeth dies, all peace returns to Scotland and Malcolm becomes the new king.
